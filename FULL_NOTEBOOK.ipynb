    "Create business unit-specific semantic views that enable natural language queries over our data warehouse.\n",

    "Semantic Views are schema-level objects in Snowflake that enable us to define business metrics, entities, and their relationships. This context will be leveraged by Cortex Analyst for generating SQL to answer natural language questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Views are comprised of the following components:\n",
    "- Tables: logical tables that map to Snowflake tables or views\n",
    "- Facts: row-level attributes tied to a logical table that represent specific business events or transactions\n",
    "- Dimensions: categorical attributes tied to a logical table that gives meaning to metrics by grouping data into meaningful categories\n",
    "- Metrics: quantifiable measures of business performance calculated by aggregating facts or other columns from the same table\n",
    "- Named filters: logic to filter a logical table based on some business rule\n",
    "- Relationships: how logical tables are mapped to one another. This enables Cortex Analyst to join multiple logical tables together\n",
